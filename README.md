qdPy is a package to compute helioseismic eigenfrequencies using
quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. 

# Forward model
Taken an input toroidal velocity profile in terms of $w_s(r)$
and computes the new eigenfrequencies using both 
degenerate perturbation theory (DPT) and quasi-degenrate
perturbation theory (QDPT).

# Inversions
-- yet to be implemented
